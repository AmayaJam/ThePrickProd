    <h3 class="edu">Self Reflection</h3>
    <br>
    <h4 class="explain">Let's look at some writing samples of this. Fair warning!!! This may be upsetting to look at for some. </h4>
   
    <div class="example">
        <img class="pic" src="comparison/website_slides-01.png" alt="">
        <img class="pic" src="comparison/website_slides-05.png" alt="">
        <img class="pic" src="comparison/website_slides-07.png" alt="">
        <img class="pic" src="comparison/website_slides-09.png" alt="">
    </div>
    <p class="explain"> At first initial glance, these sentences appear to possess an air of typicality; however, despite their adherence to grammatical norms and punctuation standards, they lack the clarity and precision that we, at The Prick Prod, have grown accustomed to.  These sentences' greatest faut pas is that they assume that the reader knows basic information. That's very presumptious. Assume they know nothing. Not everyone is graced with a comprehensive education and that's why here at The Prick Prod we encourage correctness in clear communication. Inclusivity is basic common decency and alienating people with fancy lingo does more harm than good.  </p>

    <h2 class="edu">The Second step to writing properly</h2>
    <h3 class="edu">Rewriting with sensitivity in mind</h3>
    
    <div class="img-comp-container">
        <div class="img-comp-img">
          <img src="comparison/website_slides-02.png" width="300" height="200">
        </div>
        <div class="img-comp-img img-comp-overlay">

        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="explain">The problem with this sentence is that it assumes that the reader knows what a "she" even means. Regarding the pizza, it is only repectful to clarify which kind of pizza is being refered to. There's New York style, chicago style, LA style, and many more. Though pizza only gain mass appeal when it was imported too the US by Italian immigrants, it's only fair to recognize where it got it's start.</p> 
    <div class="img-comp-container">
        <div class="img-comp-img">
          <img src="comparison/website_slides-06.png" width="300" height="200">
        </div>
        <div class="img-comp-img img-comp-overlay">

        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="explain">Though a bit of a controversial topic, names, especially those of public figures, shouldn't be changed for the ease of mind of english readers. If a public figure is from a country that uses a non-germanic writing system, care should be taken in writing the name as closely to the original as possible. In the case of the Russian author, who we know as Leo Tolstoy, "Leo" is but an English approximation to his actual name "Lyof". It's also important to teach people how to pronounce foreign names in the most accurate way possible. The phonetic alphabet can be very helpful in these instances. </p>

    <div class="img-comp-container">
        <div class="img-comp-img">
          <img src="comparison/website_slides-10.png" width="300" height="200">

        <div class="img-comp-img img-comp-overlay">
          <img src="comparison/website_slides-09.png" width="300" height="200">
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="explain">This is a tricky one. The starting sentence is correct in saying that clear communication is important. That is our entire mission but it undersells how pivotal clear communication is in our digital age. </p>
